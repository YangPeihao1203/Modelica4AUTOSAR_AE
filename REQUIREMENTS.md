# System Requirements

This document describes the recommended hardware and software environment required to execute and reproduce the artifact experiments.

---

## ðŸ’» Hardware Requirements

- **CPU**: x86_64 architecture
- **Memory**: Minimum 8 GB RAM
- **Disk Space**: At least 2 GB available storage

---

## ðŸ§° Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or higher (64-bit)

- **Modeling Environment Options**:
  - **MWORKS Sysplorer 2024b or 2025a**  
    Official website: [https://www.tongyuan.cc/product/MWorksSysplorer](https://www.tongyuan.cc/product/MWorksSysplorer)  
    > ðŸ“Œ Note: Sysplorer is currently **freely available only in mainland China**. If you are unable to obtain it, you may use OpenModelica as an alternative.
  
  - **OpenModelica 1.25.1 (64-bit)**  
    Download: [https://build.openmodelica.org/omc/builds/windows/releases/1.25/1/64bit/](https://build.openmodelica.org/omc/builds/windows/releases/1.25/1/64bit/)  
    > ðŸ§ª All models are fully compatible with the Modelica language standard and have been successfully reproduced using OpenModelica. However, simulation performance (e.g., speed and stability) may be lower compared to commercial tools like Sysplorer.

- **Modelica Standard Library (MSL)**: Version **4.0.0**  
  This is typically pre-installed in both Sysplorer and OpenModelica environments.
